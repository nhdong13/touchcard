# This module is used for manually sending promo using `rake`. This is achieved
# by connecting to a remote DB with a local version of the app, or running rake
# on the remote environment directly.
#
# It's not perfect, but works for now. See Google Doc `SOP - Send Sample Postcard` for details

  # A `lob_address` looks like this:
  # addr = {
  #   name: name,
  #   address_line1: address1,
  #   address_line2: address2,
  #   address_city: city,
  #   address_state: province_code,
  #   address_country: country_code,
  #   address_zip: zip
  # }

  # Todo: We should  probably refactor this into `send_card` and share it with `send_card` in postcard.rb
  # we could have another method for sending a promo card (or, better yet, a way to do it from ActiveAdmin)
